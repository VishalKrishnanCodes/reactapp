# Student Login React App

Simple React app with a student login database that allows only 3 admins to navigate to a landing page showing an academic year dropdown for easy perusal of student details. Upon clicking a student row, it further navigates to another page containing only the personal information about that particular student.  
Run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
